    <h2>The ESG Framework and a timeline of the student protest</h2>
    <p>As of July 11th, 2025, the University has produced a template ESG document outlining the committee’s recommended investment guidelines. It comes more than a year after the student protest, which urged disclosure and divestment from the Israel, and six months past their original promise to disclose investments on January 1st, 2025. The 10-page document is well-written, and I encourage you to read it yourself, but it needs more campus context. Not at fault to the contributors but rather administration, it gives the University too much grace while neglecting the pivotal student role. Feel free to skip to the bottom for a summary on the ESG Framework.</p>
  <p>More than a year ago, on April 30th, 2024, students led a march which ended in a 3-day encampment on the steps of All Saints’ chapel, with some students going so far as to take the ramparts on top of the chapel. It was a provocative location, and it gave administration much anxiety; former Erica Howard multiple times approached the student protestors, asking that they leave “for their own safety.” By no means was this a threat, but also distinctly unrelated to their spots on the ramparts. Students were well-fed and the biggest threat they faced was light rain. The protest ended when Dr. Pearigen promised the creation of an ESG committee and full, industry-level disclosure of investments by January 1st, 2025.</p>
    <p>What followed was a post-protest limbo, where students and faculty were invited to an awkward discussion in June on investment practices which ended without any conclusions, but plenty of confusion. During this time, January 1st inched nearer and the University published the protest policy, or “Peaceful Assembly Policy,” which outlined in admin-speak that students really can’t protest unless it’s registered on Engage, making any future protests a glorified pancake breakfast. As well, they made the University Posting Policy, which banishes posters to the dark corners of bulletin boards. </p>
    <p>Toward the end of the Fall semester, and closer to the original deadline, still nothing had changed. There were no signs of divestment, and the ESG committee, supposedly drafting a report, hadn’t been formed. However, right at the end of the semester, an ESG advisory group was finally formed to begin work in January. The new year’s deadline was out the window, but there were signs of progress.</p>
    <p>When the committee finally met, a few things became apparent. First, that our group was purely advisory—it had no official power of implementation, but rather, we were tasked with persuading the Investment Management Committee at the Board of Regents. Who was in this committee remained anonymous to us, and we were not allowed to communicate directly with them. Instead, like some Big Brother, we had to work under our assumption of the Regents’ eye, precluding possibly aggressive language. “Demand” became “implore” became “encourage,” and an executive summary was drafted as a more immediately legible version of the full document for the Regents’ convenience. The biggest obstacle quickly became our own inability to see the investments at any level. Still, there were still no compromises in the substance of the framework. The contents of the document were agreed upon on our last meeting in May, and over the summer it was drafted, edited, and finalized. </p>
    <p>Otherwise, the process was smooth. Doug Williams, who recently stepped down as the school’s treasurer, was a likely antagonist as the former star of a New York Times article on Sewanee’s divestment resistance. But, probably thanks to the New York Times, Doug was largely helpful and interested. Now, we are only waiting for the Regents to respond at the end of a long road. </p>
    <h2>What now?</h2>
    <p>Thankfully, not much; as a direct petition to the Board of Regents, we can expect a final yes or no, which is monumental for the effort. Their response will determine next steps, and we can hope that the Regents will adopt the ESG framework. The 5 year old NYT article argued in terms of publicity that it was a necessary step for attracting new students, but admissions should be negligible in the light of humanitarian crisis—the Board of Regents, by denying the framework, would be doubling down on funding genocide in Gaza, global warming and for-profit incarceration for the sake of the green and bloody Return On Investment. </p>
