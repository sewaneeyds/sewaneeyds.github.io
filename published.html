          This document was drafted during Spring semester 2025 by the ESG
          Working Group. While the group had no official authority--that is, it
          could not enforce a investment policy--it was tasked with creating an
          advisory document to be sent to the Board of Regents, who then get to
          decide whether or not to adopt the policy. This document closely
          follows the
          <a

          but incorporates more policies, including channels for disclosure and
          petitions. This committee was spurred on by student protestors, and we
          hope it is adopted!
